Known Issues:

* We know that we can't change the Denomination and Description of the VM's
  because the API Rest fails, we are working on this issue
  trying to fix it a soon as possible.
* The parallelism, as you know Terraform has the option to create different
  resources at the same time, but the API Rest of VmWare Workstation PRO
  hasn't the option to create multiple resources at the same time, for that
  reason, you will need to use the flag -parallelism=1 when you run the command Terraform.
