# VMware Workstation Provider

The VMware Workstation provider gives Terraform the ability to work with VMware Workstation Pro
Products, notably [VMware Workstation][vmware-worstation].
This provider can be used to manage many aspects of a VMware Worstation Pro
environment, including virtual machines, datastores, and more.

Use the navigation on the left to read about the various resources and data
sources supported by the provider.

~> **NOTE:** This provider requires API REST enable on VMware Worstation Pro.

  [VmWare Workstation API Rest]: https://github.com/elsudano/vmware-workstation-api-client

## Argument Reference

The provider configuration block accepts the following arguments. In general, it's better to set them via indicated environment variables to keep the configuration safe.

##### 1.- *user*
> (Required) Username that will be used to authenticate in the API REST of VmWare Workstation. It is recommended to be set via VMWS_USER environment variable.

##### 2.- *password*
> (Required) Matcnhing password for the user to authenticate in the API REST of VmWare Workstation. It is recommended to be set via VMWS_PASSWORD environment variable.

##### 3.- *path*
> (Required) This is the path where the VmWare Workstation software save the vitual machines when we was creating, so ideally, there is the place to save all the instances that we will create. I t you want to use a Windows path like "D:\Virtual Machines" You will need scape the slash like that "D:\\\Virtual Machines", in Linux isn't necessary.

##### 3.- *url*
> (Required) This is the URL where the API REST of VmWare Workstation are listen, normally in "https://localhost:8697/api". It is recommended to be set via VMWS_URL environment variable.

##### 4.- *https*
> (Optional) This parameter is false for now the API REST of VmWare Workstation just listen in http, but the comunnication it's encrypted, because to use is necessary created a certificate, maybe in the future VmWare change this, for that, is this variable. It is recommended to be set via VMWS_HTTPS environment variable.

##### 5.- *debug*
> (Optional) The last one is the variable to setting the debug mode, when it's a true, the provider module print in the log of Terraform some actions and is easier find bug. It is recommended to be set via VMWS_DEBUG environment variable.

## Example Usage

In file main.tf:

```HLC
terraform {
  required_version = ">= 0.14.4"
  required_providers {
    vmworkstation = {
      source  = "elsudano/vmworkstation"
      version = "1.0.4"
    }
  }
}
resource "vmworkstation_vm" "test_machine" {
  sourceid     = var.vmws_reource_frontend_sourceid
  denomination = var.vmws_reource_frontend_denomination
  description  = var.vmws_reource_frontend_description
  path         = var.vmws_reource_frontend_path
  processors   = var.vmws_reource_frontend_processors
  memory       = var.vmws_reource_frontend_memory
}
```

In file output.tf

```HLC
output vmws_frontend_id {
  value       = vmworkstation_vm.test_machine.id
  description = "This is the id of the VM"
}
```

In file variables.tf

```HLC
variable "vmws_reource_frontend_sourceid" {
  type        = string
  description = "(Required) The ID of the VM that to use for clone at the new"
}
variable "vmws_reource_frontend_denomination" {
  type        = string
  description = "(Required) The Name of VM in WS"
  default     = "NewInstance"
}
variable "vmws_reource_frontend_description" {
  type        = string
  description = "(Required) The Description at later maybe to explain the instance"
}
variable "vmws_frontend_path" {
  type        = string
  description = "(Required) The Path where will be our instance in VmWare"
}
variable "vmws_reource_frontend_processors" {
  type        = string
  description = "(Required) The number of processors of the Virtual Machine"
  default     = "1"
}
variable "vmws_reource_frontend_memory" {
  type        = string
  description = "(Required) The size of memory to the Virtual Machine"
  default     = "512"
}
```

### Useful commands in order to obtain the SourceID or ParentID

Kee in mind that you will be able to change the gaps about of the password, user and localhost server if is necessary

```bash
curl -k 'https://localhost:8697/api/vms' -u '<User>:<Password>' -X GET --header 'Accept: application/vnd.vmware.vmw.rest-v1+json'
```

### Useful commands to handle the infrastructure:

```bash
export VMWS_USER="xxxx"; \
export VMWS_PASSWORD="xxxx"; \
export VMWS_URL="https://localhost:8697/api"; \
terraform plan 
```

### Session persistence options

### Debugging options

To find fastly the outputs of the provider in the Terraform logs you can use the follow command:

```bash
watch -t -n 5 "cat <log file> | grep -e VMWS -e WSAPICLI -e $(date +%Y-%m-%d) | tail -15"
```
